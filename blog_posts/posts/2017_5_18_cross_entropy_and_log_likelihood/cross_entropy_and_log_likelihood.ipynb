If the outcome is not $x_1$ then we have to ask a second question. The entropy is just the expected number of yes/no questions you'll need to ask; it's the sum of the number of questions for each possible outcome, each weighted by the probability of that outcome.

We can remember this by remembering the idea that the base-2 log of the (inverse) probability for each possible outcome measures the number of yes/no questions we have to ask (each time bisecting the probability space) in order to determine that that outcome occurred. To calculate the average number of questions we have to ask, we just weight each number by the true probability of each outcome.
