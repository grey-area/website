    "[Gavin Brown](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~gbrown/) and I gave a talk today at the 2018 Arm Research Summit. This is a talk about our work with [Mikel Luj√°n](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/people/mlujan/), [Henry Reeve](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~reeveh/), and Charles Reynolds in training modular ensembles of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a machine learning talk aimed at a non-machine learning audience, and we touched on the *robustness of the trained ensembles to dropping out models* and the largely decoupled nature of the training, which allows *parallel training of the ensemble with low communication overheads*."
